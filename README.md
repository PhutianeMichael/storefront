## Project Structure

This project uses a **feature-based folder structure** for scalability and maintainability. Each main feature of the app resides in its own directory under `src/app/`.

```
src/
  app/
    feature/
        cart/
          components/
          services/
          store/
          cart.module.ts
        products/
          components/
          services/
          store/
          products.module.ts
        auth/
          components/
          services/
          store/
          auth.module.ts
    shared/
      components/
      directives/
      pipes/
    core/
      services/
      interceptors/
      guards/
    app.module.ts
    app-routing.module.ts
  assets/
  environments/
  # ...other standard Angular files and folders
```

- **Feature folders** (`cart/`, `products/`, `auth/`): Contain components, services, state management (NgRx), and module files for each feature.
- **shared/**: Reusable components, pipes, and directives.
- **core/**: Singleton services, interceptors, and guards used app-wide.

## Customization

- Modify product data and categories in the backend API or mock data files (see `src/assets/mock-data/` or your backend service).
- Update UI styles in `src/styles.scss`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter `Module not found` or similar errors, ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`.
- For port conflicts, change the port with `ng serve --port 4300`.
- For issues with the backend API, check your API server is running and accessible.
