## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Frontend framework for building the single-page application
- **TypeScript**: Primary programming language
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Markup and styling
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming library for handling asynchronous operations
- **Angular CLI**: Development tooling and build system

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** (version 6.x or higher) or **yarn** (version 1.22.x or higher)
- **Angular CLI** (version 12.x or higher)

To install Angular CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhutianeMichael/storefront.git
cd storefront
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

or if you prefer yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

### Development Server

Run the application in development mode:

```bash
ng serve
```

or

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding

Generate new components, services, and other Angular artifacts:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
ng generate service service-name
ng generate module module-name
```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

#### Unit Tests

Run unit tests using Karma:

```bash
ng test
```

#### End-to-End Tests

Run end-to-end tests using Protractor:

```bash
ng e2e
```

### Code Quality

#### Linting

Check code quality and style:

```bash
ng lint
```

Fix linting issues automatically:

```bash
ng lint --fix
```

### Building for Production

Build the project for production deployment:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. The production build optimizes the application for:

- Minification
- Tree-shaking
- Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation
- Lazy loading
- Code splitting

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to various platforms:

### Deploy to Firebase

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init
firebase deploy
```

### Deploy to Netlify

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist/storefront
```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
ng build --prod --base-href "https://PhutianeMichael.github.io/storefront/"
npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/storefront
```
